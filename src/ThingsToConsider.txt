Something needs to be "flipped"

Either the display, or the single man movment algorithm
  
The reason: Single men can only move forward. which means that forward for black, would be reverse for red. As turns are completed the algorythm for forward movement would neev to "flip"

Alternately, If the display can be manipulated so that the (0,0) for black is in the (7,7) position for the red player and viceversa this may work better[Player One's checkers are aligned at the bottom of player one's screen while Player Two's checkers are aligned at the bottom of player Two's Screen]. In my mind, this would be cleaner presentation and would simplify movement coding.

ANOTHER THING TO THINK ABOUT:
 The legal movement algorithms should be run after the switch from opponent to player BEFORE THE PLAYER EXECUTES A MOVE. This is the case because the "game" needs to know if there are 0 legal moves, at which point the game ends...
